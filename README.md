# 🎬 Movie Watch History Analysis (EDA Project)

This project was conducted solely for the purpose of **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**. It involves analyzing a dataset containing user movie-watching history to uncover viewing trends, habits, and patterns. Through this analysis, we gained insights into the most-watched movies, recent activity, and overall viewer behavior.

## 📁 Project Overview

Understanding user behavior is key for content recommendation and platform optimization. In this project, we performed a thorough analysis of a movie-watching dataset to answer questions such as:

* Which movies are watched most frequently?
* What is the viewer's most recently watched content?
* Are there patterns in viewing behavior over time?

This analysis serves as a foundation for building more advanced systems, such as recommendation engines or personalized content strategies.

## 🔍 Objectives

* Practice and improve EDA skills using a real-world dataset
* Identify the most-watched movies by a viewer
* Determine recent viewing activity
* Visualize viewing habits and frequency patterns

## 🧰 Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – Data wrangling and manipulation
* **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization
* **Jupyer Notebook** – Interactive analysis and visualization


```

## 📈 Key Insights

* Identified the top N most frequently watched movies by the user.
* Tracked the most recent movie watched and the time of viewing.
* Analyzed patterns in viewing frequency over time (e.g., peak watch hours or days).
* Created visualizations to highlight behavior trends and preferences.
